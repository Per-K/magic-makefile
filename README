  Magic Makefile
==================

  This is a generic Makefile for simple C/C++ projects with automatic
generation of dependency rules. So that it is not necessary to specify
the dependencies between the C/C++ files and their headers.


 How to use it
---------------

  Copy src/Makefile to your source code directory and edit it to adjust
a few variables. For simplicity, it is assumed that your project only
generates a single binary.


 How to try it
---------------

  There is a simple hello world program written in C in src/, so then
just run:

	$ make
	# And later to clean:
	$ make clean

The Makefile outside src/ just invokes recursively the Makefile in src/.
