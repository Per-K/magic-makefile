 Nice Makefile
===============

  This is a simple Makefile that serves as a template for C/C++ projects
with several files which generates a single binary. The nice thing about
the Makefile is that it generates automatically the dependence rules and
that is only necessary to customize a few variables to set the desired
compilation flags.

  The C++ files extension is assumed to be .cpp, so feel free to adjust
that if necessary.

  The source code should be placed in src/ where also there is a nice
Makefile which handles automatically the dependencies between files.

  Outside, here in this directory, there is a very simple Makefile which
calls recursively to the Makefile in src/ for `make' and `make clean'.

  To try Makefile, there is in src/ a simple Hello world program written
in C with 2 code files and 2 headers.
